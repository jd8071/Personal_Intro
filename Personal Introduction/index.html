            <h3>Favorite Culture:</h3>
            <p>
                I have always been very interested in any of the Asian cultures. I've studied a couple different martial arts, and I think the religions in those countries are extremely interesting to learn about.
                Second to that, any Indigenous cultures in North America. There are so many, and each one is so different from the others.

            <h3>Historical Figures:</h3>
            <p>
                There aren't many historical figures that I personally relate to, but I have always been fond of Betty White, Emily Dickinson, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
                Although most of the work done by these three women is much higher than the level I work at, I think everything they've done to help others is amazing.

            <h3>Representative Meal:</h3>
            <p>
                Anything made with potatoes. I think I'm quite versatile and can fit into almost any situation, mold to others work styles, and I like to believe I can cheer people up.

            <h3>I feel most creative when I</h3>
            <p>
                am reading or building Legos. Both require some use of the parts of my brain that I don't typically get to use everyday.
